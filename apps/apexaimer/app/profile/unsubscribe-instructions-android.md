title: How to cancel a subscription
---

**To cancel a subscription or a free trial on your Android device, follow these steps:**

1. Open the **Google Play Store app**.
2. Tap on the **Profile icon** in the top right corner.
3. Tap **Payments & subscriptions**.
4. Tap **Subscriptions**.
5. Find and tap on **ApexAimer**.
6. Tap **Cancel Subscription** and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the cancellation. You might need to scroll to find the "Cancel Subscription" option. If you don't see this option, the subscription may already be canceled, and you won't be charged again.

Please do this at least 24 hours before the end of the current subscription period to avoid being charged for the next cycle. Note that any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable.

## How to request a refund:

1. Visit [https://play.google.com/store/account](https://play.google.com/store/account) and sign in with your Google account if necessary.
2. Navigate to **Order History** and find the order you wish to return.
3. To the right of the order, click **Request a refund** or **Report a problem** and choose the option that best describes your situation.
4. Fill out the form and specify that you would like a refund. You will receive a message saying "Thank you for sharing your concerns." Shortly after, you will receive an email with the decision regarding your refund, typically within 15 minutes to 48 hours.
