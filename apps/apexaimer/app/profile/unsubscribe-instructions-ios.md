title: How to cancel a subscription
---

**To cancel a subscription or a free trial on your iPhone, follow these steps:**

1. Open the **Settings app**.
2. Tap your name.
3. Tap **Subscriptions**.
4. Tap on **ApexAimer**.
5. Tap **Cancel Subscription**. You might need to scroll down to find the Cancel Subscription button. The subscription is already cancelled if there is no Cancel button or you see an expiration message in red text.

Do it at least 24 hours before the end of the free trial or subscription period to avoid being charged. Any unused portion of a free trial period will be forfeited when the user purchases a Gentler Streak subscription.

## How to request a refund:

1. Go to [https://support.apple.com/billing](https://support.apple.com/billing)
2. Tap on **Start a refund request**.
