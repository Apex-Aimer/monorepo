## How

Use any of your favorite auto guns, ie assault rifles (Flatline, R-301, or if you want to challange yourself Devotion or Havoc without Turbocharger)

On the main stage in the firing range drawn lines. Stay on the closest to a dummy line. Kill the dummy with full shields within one clip. Move to the next line. Repeat.

## Why

Helps to practise recoil pattern. Dummy is closer to in-game situations than a target. Slight contant increase of a distance helps to put recoil pattern muscle memory to longer range.
