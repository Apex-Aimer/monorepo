## How

1. Equip your favorite automatic weapon, preferably an assault rifle like the Flatline, R-301, or, if you're up for a challenge, the Devotion or Havoc without Turbocharger.

2. On the main stage in the firing range, you'll find drawn lines. Start on the line closest to the target dummy.

3. Engage the target dummy, ensuring it has full shields (purple or red), and aim to eliminate it within one magazine (clip).

4. Once you've successfully taken down the dummy, advance to the next line and repeat the process.

## Why

The drill is designed to improve your ability to manage recoil patterns effectively.

The gradual increase in distance between you and the target dummy helps extend your recoil control skills to longer-range engagements.
