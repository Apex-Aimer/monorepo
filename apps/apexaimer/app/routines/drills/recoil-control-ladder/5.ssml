Let's move to Recoil control ladder

Equip your favorite automatic weapon. Set the dummy movement setting to constant strafing and add some challenge by strafing while you shoot.

On the main stage in the firing range, you'll find drawn horizontal lines. Start on the line closest to the target dummy.

Eliminate the central dummy within one magazine.

Once you've successfully taken down the dummy, advance to the next line and repeat the process.
