Equip an automatic weapon of your choice. Keep it dynamic by moving while you shoot. Increase the difficulty by hitting criticals on targets.

Engage the closest to you target. Shoot it, landing all the bullets. Remember the score you got, that's the score you should hit on every other target moving further.

After hitting the score on a target, increase the distance.
