## How

Use any of your favorite auto guns, ie assault rifles (Flatline, R-301, or if you want to challange yourself Devotion or Havoc without Turbocharger)

Shoot the target at different ranges, focusing on landing all bullets on it.

Hit goals:

- Flatline - 500
- R-301 - 350
- Havoc - 600
- Devotion - 600
- Spitfire - 1000

## Why

Helps to practise recoil pattern. Shooting targets helps to better see misses and adjust recoil based on it.
