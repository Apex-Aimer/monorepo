## How

1. Equip an automatic weapon of your choice (e.g., Flatline, R-301, or, if you want to challenge yourself, Devotion or Havoc without Turbocharger).

2. Engage the target at various ranges, with the primary focus on accurately hitting it with every shot.

3. Set achievement goals for each weapon type:
   - Flatline: 500
   - R-301: 350
   - Havoc: 600
   - Devotion: 600

## Why

Mastering recoil control for different weapons is crucial for consistently landing accurate shots, especially during mid to long-range engagements.

Practicing with specific weapons allows you to become proficient with their unique recoil patterns, significantly improving your effectiveness in real in-game scenarios.

Shooting at targets, as opposed to dummies, enhances your ability to detect and adjust for misses.
