## How

1. Begin tracking the strafing dummy using hip-fire aiming as it moves.

2. Keep your crosshair on the dummy, ensuring it remains centered as the dummy strafes left and right.

3. Focus on maintaining precise and steady tracking, minimizing crosshair deviation while hip-firing.

## Why

Developing the habit of accurately tracking and engaging opponents without aiming down sights (ADS) can significantly benefit your close-quarters combat capabilities.

Hip-fire tracking provides a larger range of motion in these intense fights, enabling you to maintain precise shots on moving targets and gain an edge in high-pressure situations.
