Now, it's time for bowl task.

Practice in mid range. Add some challenge by strafing while you shoot.

Set your weapon to the "single fire mode" or choose a non-automatic weapon. For example, consider using the Flatline or the Devotion.

Start by shooting the strafing dummy.

Swiftly flick your crosshair and shoot one of the nearest targets.

After hitting the target, promptly return to the strafing dummy and repeat the process.
