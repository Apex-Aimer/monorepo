## How

Put your gun to the "single fire mode", or use non-automatic weapon.

Harder version of targets flicking, it adds moving target to the static ones.

Set the dummy to random strafe and use it as a central target.

Start the dummy then move to any other target you'd like to hit to left, right, upward or downward. After hit return to the dummy. Repeat.

To chellange yourself try to hit headshots.

## Why

Flicking helps you to acquire targets quickly and make your crosshair placement more "sticky"
