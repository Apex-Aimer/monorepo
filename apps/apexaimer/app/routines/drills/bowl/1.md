## How

1. Set your weapon to the "single fire mode" or choose a non-automatic weapon. For example, consider using the Flatline (especially effective with a gold magazine, offering 30 bullets) or the Devotion (which provides 48 bullets before requiring a reload).

2. Start by engaging the strafing dummy, landing accurate shots to deal damage.

3. Swiftly flick your crosshair to engage a target of your choiceâ€”left, right, upward, or downward.

4. After hitting the target, promptly return to the strafing dummy and repeat the process.

5. Continue this dynamic sequence, ensuring precise flick shots and efficient transitions between the strafing dummy and the peripheral targets.

## Why

The drill enhances your reflexes, aiming precision, and adaptability in rapidly changing combat scenarios. Practicing flick shots between a strafing target and peripheral targets helps you become more effective in tracking and engaging dynamic opponents.
