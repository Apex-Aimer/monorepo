## How

1. Position your crosshair directly on the target dummy.

2. Begin moving around the dummy, either to the left or to the right, while making an effort to keep your crosshair locked onto the dummy at all times.

3. In the mixed range variation, apart from lateral movements, challenge yourself by moving closer to or farther away from the dummy while maintaining the crosshair on target.

4. To intensify the challenge, focus on keeping your crosshair centered on the dummy's head throughout the drill.

## Why

In contrast to more traditional tracking drills, the "Crosshair Lock-On Challenge" places greater emphasis on synchronized movement with your crosshair. This exercise enhances your ability to strafe and maintain accurate aiming while on the move.

Incorporate this drill into your training regimen to develop superior strafing aiming skills.
