## How:

Place the crosshair to the dummy and walking around it to the left or to the right, try to keep the crosshair at the dummy all the time.

In the mixed range variation, in addition to left and right movement, try to also go closer and farther.

To make it more challenging try to keep the crosshair at the dummy's head.

Also try to mix directions, to practise hands coordination when movement direction is changing.

## Why:

In contrast with more classic tracking drills, this one is focused more on keeping the movement with your crosshair. It helps to develop good strafing aiming.
