## How

Must use Bangalor.

Use any SMG (CAR, R-99, Volt) with 1x Digital Threat optic.

Put the smoke where dummy is.

Shoot the dummy. Try to kill the dummy with full shields within one clip.

## Why

Smoke disable aim assist.
Can be beneficial for both controller and MnK users.

For controller users allow to practise tracking in a much harder conditions.

For MnK a smoke is a counter to aim assist, thus being good in tracking through smoke allows to play better against controller players.
