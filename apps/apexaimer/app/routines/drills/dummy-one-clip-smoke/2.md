## How

1. Play as Bangalore.

2. Equip any SMG, such as CAR, R-99, or Volt, along with a 1x Digital Threat optic.

3. Deploy smoke at the location of the target dummy.

4. Engage the target dummy, aiming to eliminate it with full shields (purple or red) within one clip.

## Why

- The use of smoke disables aim assist, offering valuable training for both controller and MnK users.

- For controller users, this drill provides an opportunity to practice tracking under challenging conditions.

- MnK users can benefit from mastering tracking through smoke, as it can give them an advantage when facing controller players who rely on aim assist.
