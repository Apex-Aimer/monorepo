## How

1. Equip an automatic weapon, such as an assault rifle like the Flatline, R-301, or, for a greater challenge, the Devotion or Havoc without Turbocharger.

2. Face the target dummy, ensuring it has full shields (purple or red).

3. Begin shooting at the target dummy, aiming to eliminate it within one magazine (clip).

## Why

The drill replicates in-game situations more closely than shooting static targets.

Practicing with this drill hones your skills in managing recoil, maintaining target accuracy, and achieving efficient eliminations within the constraints of a single magazine.
