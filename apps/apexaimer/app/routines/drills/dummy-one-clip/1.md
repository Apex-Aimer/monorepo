## How

1. Equip any SMG, such as the CAR, R-99, or Volt, or for an added challenge, opt for assault rifles like the Flatline, which allows for more extended tracking.

2. Engage the central dummy.

3. Your objective is to eliminate the dummy with full shields (purple or red) within one clip.

## Why

- Enhance your proficiency in close-quarters combat, where rapid strafing movements and accurate hip-fire shots are critical.

- Develop the ability to strafe effectively while engaging targets, making you a more elusive and challenging opponent during close encounters.

- Improve your coordination between aiming and movement, ensuring you can maintain target accuracy while on the move.

- Cultivate the skill to swiftly acquire and eliminate close-range targets, a crucial asset in fast-paced engagements, especially when the opposing team is hard-pushing you.
