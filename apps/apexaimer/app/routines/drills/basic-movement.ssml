Our first challenge is a basic movement.

It's a set of simple movement tasks to get blood flowing.

On the main stage of the firing range you can find lines on the ground, your goal is to move through them and execute turns. Start with 90 degrees and progress to perform 180 degrees.

Keep close attention to make clean turns.

Intruduce slides and jumps into the flow as you progress.
