## How

1. ADS and begin tracking the strafing dummy as it moves.

2. Maintain your crosshair on the dummy, ensuring it remains centered as the dummy strafes left and right.

3. Focus on maintaining precise and steady tracking, minimizing crosshair deviation.

## Why

In Apex Legends, where time-to-kill (TTK) is relatively high, tracking your opponents effectively is essential.

This drill sharpens your ADS aiming precision and tracking skills, enabling you to consistently land shots on moving targets.
