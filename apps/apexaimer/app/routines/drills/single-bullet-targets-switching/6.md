## How

Put your gun to the "single fire mode", or use non-automatic weapon.

Start with shooting any target and then move to the closest one.

Focus on "smoothness" - straight lines between the targets in one constant motion.

Try to look on a target and not on the reticle. Whenever you shoot the target you already should look for the next one.

## Why

Targets switching helps to develop "aim smoothness".
