Moving on, we have Switch 'n Shoot: Single Shot.

Go a bit further to a midrange. Keep moving while you shoot and hit those criticals on targets.

Fire at any target, then move to the nearest target and shoot it. Repeat.

Focus on achieving a sense of "smoothness" in your movements, maintaining a constant motion with straight lines between the targets.
