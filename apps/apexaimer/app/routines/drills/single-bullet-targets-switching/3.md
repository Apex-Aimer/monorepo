## How

1. Set your weapon to the "single fire mode" or use a non-automatic weapon. For example, consider using the Flatline (especially effective with a gold magazine, offering 30 bullets) or the Devotion (which provides 48 bullets before requiring a reload).

2. Initiate the drill by firing at any target, then smoothly transition to the nearest target.

3. Focus on achieving a sense of "smoothness" in your movements, maintaining a constant motion with straight lines between the targets.

4. Train yourself to look at the targets rather than fixating on the reticle. As you eliminate one target, immediately shift your gaze to the next one in preparation.

## Why

The drill is designed to enhance "aim smoothness" by refining your ability to swiftly transition between targets with fluid, precise movements.
