## How

1. Set your weapon to the "auto fire mode."

2. Commence the drill by firing at one target and smoothly transitioning to the nearest target within your field of vision.

3. Focus on achieving a sense of "smoothness" in your movements, maintaining a continuous motion with straight lines connecting the targets.

4. Train yourself to keep your focus on the targets rather than fixating on the reticle. As you eliminate one target, promptly shift your gaze to the next one in readiness.

## Why

The drill hones your ability to land the initial shots on the target effectively.

Typically, the first bullet deals the most damage, making this drill particularly valuable for precision shooting.
