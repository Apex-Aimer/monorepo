Your next drill is Switch 'n Shoot: Low burst.

Keep it close to targets. Keep moving while you shoot.

Fire at any target, then move to the nearest target and shoot it. Land around 5 to 10 bullets. Repeat.

Focus on achieving a sense of "smoothness" in your movements, maintaining a constant motion with straight lines between the targets.
