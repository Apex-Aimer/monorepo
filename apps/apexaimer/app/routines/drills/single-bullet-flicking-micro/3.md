## How

1. Set your weapon to the "single fire mode" or choose a non-automatic weapon. For example, consider using the Flatline (especially effective with a gold magazine, offering 30 bullets) or the Devotion (which provides 48 bullets before requiring a reload).

2. Incorporate various scopes, such as 1x, 2x, 3x, or 2-4x scopes, into your practice. Different scopes may have distinct sensitivity settings, and practicing with a range of scopes helps you adapt to various engagement situations and sensitivity configurations.

3. Begin by firing at the central target, then execute rapid, precise flick shots to smaller, peripheral targetsâ€”left, right, upward, or downward. After each hit, swiftly return to the central target.

4. Repeat the flick shots with micro-level precision and speed, ensuring seamless transitions between targets.

## Why

The drill sharpens your reflexes and aiming precision to an intricate level.

It's designed to develop your ability to execute rapid, accurate engagements with small, peripheral targets, a skill that can be crucial in high-pressure situations.
