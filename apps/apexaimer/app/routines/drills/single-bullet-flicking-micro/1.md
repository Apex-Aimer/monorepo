## How

Put your gun to the "single fire mode", or use non-automatic weapon.

Start with shooting the central target, then move to any other target you'd like to hit to left, right, upward or downward. After hit return to the central target. Repeat.

Focus on "micro" crosshair movement, meaning you should shoot only the closest targets.

## Why

Flicking helps you to acquire targets quickly and make your crosshair placement more "sticky"
