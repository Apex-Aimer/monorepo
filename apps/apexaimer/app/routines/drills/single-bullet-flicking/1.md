## How

1. Set your weapon to the "single fire mode" or choose a non-automatic weapon. For instance, you can opt for the Flatline, which becomes especially effective with a gold magazine, offering 30 bullets, or the Devotion, providing 48 bullets before requiring a reload.

2. Begin by firing at the central target, then smoothly transition to any other target of your choiceâ€”left, right, upward, or downward. After hitting the secondary target, return to the central target.

3. Repeat the flick shots with precision and speed, ensuring seamless transitions between targets.

## Why

The drill hones your reflexes and aiming precision.

It is particularly effective for developing the ability to rapidly and accurately engage multiple targets, making it an essential skill for high-pressure situations.
