## How

1. Position yourself away from the target dummy, facing in the opposite direction.

2. Quickly turn around and fire at the target dummy, aiming to eliminate it as swiftly as possible within a single magazine (clip).

## Why

The drill challenges your reflexes and aiming speed by requiring you to engage a target as soon as you face it, simulating surprise encounters in Apex Legends. This drill sharpens your ability to react swiftly to unexpected threats and deliver precise shots under pressure, making you a more agile and effective player in real-game situations.
