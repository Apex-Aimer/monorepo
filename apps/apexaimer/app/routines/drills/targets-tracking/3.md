## How

1. Begin tracking the target's movements as it shifts around.

2. Keep your crosshair on the moving target, ensuring it remains centered as the target moving.

3. Focus on maintaining precise and steady tracking, minimizing crosshair deviation.

## Why

In Apex Legends, where time-to-kill (TTK) is relatively high, the ability to track and engage multiple targets is invaluable.

This skill is essential in hectic engagements, allowing you to maintain accurate shots on dynamic targets and secure eliminations in challenging scenarios.
