Simple movement to get blood flowing.

## How

Start by positioning your character at the beginning of the firing range, facing forward. Your goal is to navigate through a series of predefined lines on the ground and execute turns of 90 degrees and 180 degrees smoothly.

- Begin by running along the line.
- As you approach a turn, execute a clean 90-degree or 180-degree turn.
- After completing the turn, continue following the next line segment.
- Introduce slides and slide jumps into the flow as you progress.

There are no strict rules for the order, so you can go with whatever you feel can warm you up effectively at the moment.

## Why

This drill enhances your agility, reflexes, and overall movement control.

Don't underestimate the effectiveness of simple turns; clean 90 or 180-degree turns are excellent for preparing for other tracking or precision tasks.
