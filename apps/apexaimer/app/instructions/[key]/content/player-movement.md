Stationary drills have their own set of benefits.

They allow you to focus solely on aiming accuracy and building a strong foundation in crosshair placement.

Beginners, in particular, can benefit from this approach as it simplifies the learning process and helps develop precise and consistent aiming skills.

Stationary drills are also useful for isolated target practice, such as honing flick shots or improving headshot accuracy.

Incorporating strafing into your practice routine can provide several advantages.

It mirrors real in-game situations, where you're rarely standing still.

Practicing aiming while strafing helps you develop the ability to track targets while on the move, a vital skill for both offensive and defensive gameplay.

It enhances your reflexes and hand-eye coordination, making you more adaptable in high-pressure situations.

Generally, drills in routines start in a stationary mode, and as you progress within the app's level system, they naturally transition towards being performed in strafing mode
