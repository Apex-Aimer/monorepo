You'll encounter three distinct ranges during your drills: close, mid, and long.

We might not have exact measurements for these ranges, but here's how we typically divide them:

- **Close Range**: Feel the heat as you engage enemies within the 8-15 meter zone. It's up close and personal!

- **Mid Range**: Things get intense at a distance of 30-40 meters â€“ precision is your key to victory.

- **Long Range**: Become a true marksman with foes at a distant 65-110 meters.
