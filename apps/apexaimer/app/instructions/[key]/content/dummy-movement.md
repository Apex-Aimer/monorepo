You'll find the **Dummy Movement** setting nestled within the **CUSTOMIZE RANGE** section, accessible via the inventory menu or by simply holding the map button.

There are three possible settings we're going to use throughout our routines:

1. Dummy stays in place

2. Dummy strafing in constant motion (meaning it's very predictable because it remains the same all the time)

3. Dummy strafing in random motion (meaning it's less predictable and closer to real strafing, although still quite different from what a real opponent would do)
